1. During the game, you can press the arrow keys to move the player
	- Left/Right: movement in those directions respectively
	- Up: player jumps/floats
	- Down: player crouches and allows balloons to be placed closer to ankle level

2. Press A to drop/use the balloon type that is selected

3. Press B to taunt the bees on the screen and make them angry. The ants and queen bee are always angry. When an enemy is angry, they will chase you and sting you.

4. Press L or R to shift between different balloon types. 
	- Red only damages one enemy but does significantly more damage
	- Yellow damages enemies within its area of affect but does less damage than red
	- Blue lets you jump higher and walk around on the clouds
	- Multicolored balloon is the cheat balloon that kills every enemy on screen.

5. If the enemy collides with a red or yellow balloon, it will take damage. You can't move on to the next level without killing all the enemies on that level.

6. Enemy types
	- Bees: not always angry but do not appreciate being taunted or approached
	- Bee Larvae: angry, annoying, and do little damage but they like to bite ankles
	- Queen Bee: the mother of all bees, be careful with her shooting stinger
